# LaTeX PDF management bundle

Version: 0.96s, 2025-06-23

This package is used to load the new PDF management code
of LaTeX.

The new PDF management code offers backend independent interfaces to central
PDF dictionaries, tools to create annotations, form Xobjects, to embed
files, and to handle PDF standards.

The code is currently provided as independent package. It is automatically
loaded if a document uses `\DocumentMetadata`. It can also be loaded as a package.
At a later stage it will be integrated into the LaTeX kernel (or in parts into permanent support packages).

## Feedback
Bug reports and feedback are welcome and should be made at

## Requirements

and L3 programming layer.

## Installation

Installation should be done with the package managers of the TeX systems.

.sty, .def, .ltx, .lua into tex/latex/pdfmanagement-testphase.
