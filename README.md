# LaTeX PDF management testphase bundle

Version: 0.96n, 2024-10-27

This package is used during a test phase to load the new PDF management code
of LaTeX.

The new PDF management code offers backend independent interfaces to central
PDF dictionaries, tools to create annotations, form Xobjects, to embed
files, and to handle PDF standards.

The code is provided during a test phase as independent package to allow
user and package authors to safely test the code. At a later stage it will
be integrated into the LaTeX kernel (or in parts into permanent support
packages) and the current test phase bundle will be removed.

## Feedback
Bug reports and feedback are welcome and should be made at 
https://github.com/latex3/pdfresources

## Requirements 
The package requires a current LaTeX format
and L3 programming layer.

## Installation

Installation should be done with the package managers of the TeX systems.

.sty, .def, .ltx, .lua into tex/latex/pdfmanagement-testphase.
