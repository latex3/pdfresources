% \maketitle
% \begin{documentation}
% This module generates a generic driver for \pkg{hyperref} meant to be used
% with the new \LaTeX{} PDF management code. It is loaded automatically
% if the PDF management code is active. The name of the driver will change after
% the testphase.
%
% The generic driver can be used with pdflatex, lualatex, xelatex, latex with
% dvipdfmx, latex with dvips+ps2pdf. latex with dvips+distiller could work too
% but is untested. (x)dvipdfmx will probably soon support dvilualatex, then this
% combination should work too.
%
% The driver \emph{requires} the new PDF management code, so documents wanting to use it
% should start like this
% \begin{verbatim}
% \RequirePackage{pdfmanagement-testphase} %loads the code
% \DocumentMetadata % activates it
%   {
%    %% options
%    %% e.g. pdf version, backend:
%    % pdfversion=1.7,
%    % backend = dvipdfmx
%   }
%  \end{verbatim}
%
%  Starting with \LaTeX-2022-06-01 (or a suitable latex-dev) loading the testphase
%  package is no longer required and this can be simplified to
% \begin{verbatim}
% \DocumentMetadata
%   {
%    %% options
%    %% e.g. pdf version, backend:
%    % pdfversion=1.7,
%    % backend = dvipdfmx
%   }
%  \end{verbatim}

%  The new driver tries to be compatible with the standard \pkg{hyperref} drivers
%  but there are nevertheless differences. Some of them due to the still experimental
%  status of the driver, others are design decisions: one part of the project is
%  to clean up and modernize the code. The following sections try to describe
%  the differences but also to document some of the rationales of the changes,
%  and to add some details and comments about the existing options and so to
%  extend the \pkg{hyperref} manual.
%
%  \section{Avoiding transition problems}
%  Some code will only work properly after other packages have been adapted to
%  the new PDF management code and the changes in this driver.
%  This will take some time. Until then it is recommended to follow
%  the following rules
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item Package options are processed at the end of the driver,
%  Class options are ignored. But not every option already works as package options,
%  in some cases \pkg{hyperref} interferes. So
%  it is recommended for most options ---with the exception of a few mentioned below in
%  section~\ref{sec:pkg-options}---to set them in \cs{hypersetup},
%  not as package option.
%  \item This driver uses the \pkg{l3color} module for the colors. All colors
%  defined with \cs{color_set:nn} or \cs{color_set:nnn} will work.
%  Colors defined with \pkg{xcolor} will work if they don't use one of
%  the special color models not supported by \pkg{l3color} as
%  \pkg{pdfmanagement-firstaid} contains a patch for xcolor.
%  If the package \pkg{color} is used it is currently recommended to define
%  colors after \pkg{hyperref}.
%  \item Load a color package or graphicx to get the right page sizes.
%  \item Report problems! Only known problem can be resolved.
%  \end{itemize}
%
%
%  \section{Bookmarks / outlines}
%  The new driver doesn't contain code to handle bookmarks/outlines.
%  Instead it forces the loading of the \pkg{bookmark} package
%  unless the package option |bookmarks=false|
%  has been used. Currently \pkg{bookmark} is loaded at the end of the preamble
%  so if commands from \pkg{bookmark} are needed in the preamble the document
%  should load it manually. This is subject to change at some time in the future.
%
%  \section{\enquote{Metadata}}
%
%  \enquote{Metadata}, informations about the document, are stored in a PDF in two
%  places: The |/Info| dictionary and the XMP-metadata. \pkg{hyperref} only handles the
%  |/Info| dictionary. The XMP-metadata can be added with like \pkg{pdfx} and
%  \pkg{hyperxmp}.
%
%  The |/Info| dictionary can be filled with arbitrary keys, but the PDF viewer typically
%  care only about a few, like |/Author|, |/Title| and |/Keywords|.
%  A number of |/Info| keys, like dates and the producer, are added automatically
%  by the engines and backends.
%  Some of them can only be removed with special commands, some not at all.
%  But---with the exception of |/Producer| when using the dvips backend---they
%  can be overwritten.
%
%  The current handling of the metadata is problematic:
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item External package like \pkg{hyperxmp} wants to access them too and for
%  this had to patch an number of internal \pkg{hyperref} commands---which is a problem
%  if the internal commands change (as happens with this new driver)
%  \item \pkg {hyperref} (and also \pkg{hyperxmp})
%  tries to deduce some datas from document commands like
%  \cs{title} or \cs{author}---something that worked reasonably well when only
%  some standard classes with well-known definitions of these command existed,
%  but gets problematic with classes and packages which define
%  more powerful commands knowing a variety of optional arguments to set authors and
%  affiliations and title information.
%  \end{itemize}
%
%  To resolve some of this problem the driver will
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item \emph{Not} try deduce author and title from documents. They have to be set in
%  \cs{hypersetup} with |pdfauthor| and |pdftitle|. It is recommended to separate
%  more than one author by commas, and to hide commas inside braces if needed:
%
%  \begin{verbatim}
%  pdfauthor = {Bär, Peter Anteater, {Riley, the sloth}}
%  \end{verbatim}
%  \item All values of relevant keys (including keys from the hyperxmp package)
%  will be stored in a Metadata container, and can be retrieved with
%  \cs{GetDocumentProperties}.
%
%  \begin{verbatim}
%  \edef\my@pdfauthor{\GetDocumentProperties{hyperref/pdfauthor}}
%  \end{verbatim}
%  If the key hasn't be set, the result is empty. This gives external
%  packages a public and reliable access to the data.
%
%  \item |pdflang| is deprecated. Instead \cs{DocumentMetadata} should be used:
%  \begin{verbatim}
%  \cs{DocumentMetadata}{lang=de-DE}
%  \end{verbatim}
%
%  The value can be retrieved as |document/lang|.
%
%  \end{itemize}
%  \section{Dates}
%  \pkg{hyperref} has a few keys to set dates. They typically expect the date
%  in \enquote{PDF} format: |D:YYYYMMDDhhmmss+01'00'|.
%
%  One should be aware that \pkg{hyperxmp} will sometimes
%  overwrites such settings.
%  ^^A XMP: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss+tt:tt, PDF: D:YYYYMMDDhhmmss+01'00'
%
%  \section{PDF page size (mediabox)}
%  The standard \pkg{hyperref} driver contain code to set the PDF page size.
%  There is no real justification why this is done by \pkg{hyperref} apart from the
%  fact that \LaTeX{} itself doesn't do it and that the needed special code could
%  be added to the backend drivers.
%
%  In the new driver this code is gone. The reason is not that it is
%  difficult to set the MediaBox, actually it could be done with one line of code:
%  \begin{verbatim}
%  \pdfmanagement_add:nnn{Page}{MediaBox}
%    {[0~0~\dim_to_decimal_in_bp:n{\paperwidth}~
%          \dim_to_decimal_in_bp:n{\paperheight}]}
%  \end{verbatim}
%
%  The problem is to know which value to use (with the memoir class e.g.\cs{stockwidth}
%  should be used instead of \cs{paperwidth}),
%  and detecting this not a \pkg{hyperref} task. Instead the packages which change
%  these values should also set the PDF page size. Also there are
%  too many actors here: color/graphicx, geometry,the KOMA-classes, memoir,
%  \ldots\ all try to set this.
%
%  So if the PDF page size is wrong: load one of the other packages setting it
%  e.g. the \pkg{color} or the \pkg{graphicx} package.
%
% \section{Commands to create \enquote{external} references}
% \pkg{hyperref} has three commands related to external references like
% URL and file: \cs{url},
% \cs{nolinkurl} and \cs{href}. The first two take one argument,
% while the last has two: the url and some free text.
%
%
% \cs{url} and \cs{href} create link annotations. \cs{url} creates always an URI
% type, \cs{href} creates URI, GoToR and Launch
% depending on the structure of the argument.
%
% \cs{href} has to create a (in the PDF) valid url or file name from its first argument.
% \cs{url} has to create a (in the PDF) valid url from its only argument and has also to print
% this argument as url. \cs{nolinkurl} only prints the url.
%
% For the printing \cs{url} and \cs{nolinkurl} rely on the url package and its \cs{Url} command.
%
% (Expandable) commands are expanded and special chars can also be input by commands but
% beside this no conversion is done: for all input \pkg{hyperref} basically assumes that
% the input is already a valid percent encoded url or a valid file name. \pkg{hyperref} also
% doesn't extend or add protocols.
%
% As nowadays everyone is used to copy and paste links with all sorts of unicode into a browser and
% they work the \pkg{hyperref} input is clearly rather restricted.
%
% So the new driver tries to extend the input and print options. Both \cs{href} and \cs{url}
% can now be told to accept non-ascii url's and to convert them internally to
% percent encoding. It is possible to define a standard protocol and so to avoid to
% have to type it all the time.
%
% But extending the \emph{print} options for \cs{url} and \cs{nolinkurl} while still
% using the url-package is hard to impossible in pdf\LaTeX{} due to the way the url package works.
% Some chars can be added with the help of \cs{UrlSpecial} (at the cost of warnings)
% but it doesn't work for every input and documenting and explaining all the edge cases is no joy.
% So instead the new driver offers here the option to use different commands to format
% the printed output. It must be noted that this disable the special \enquote{hyphenation} method of
% url's.
%
%
% \subsection{Special problem: links to files}
%
% When a file is linked with \cs{href} than normally it is added as URI link. The exceptions are PDF's:
% for them PDF has the special type GoToR which allows also to link to a destination or a special page.
%
% After a number of tests with various PDF viewer established that non-ascii files names don't
% work at all with a simple file name specification GoToR links now use a full
% filespec dictionary. This works better, but still no every PDF viewer support this correctly.
% on various system.
%
% The following can be used to test viewers. It assumes that a \texttt{test.pdf},
% a \texttt{grüßpdf.pdf} and a \texttt{grüße.txt} are in the current folder.
%
% \hrefpdf{test.pdf}{test-ascii}
%
% \hrefpdf{grüßpdf.pdf}{test grüßpdf.pdf}
%
% \hrefurl[urlencode]{grüße.txt}{test grüße.txt}
%
%
% \subsection{Splits}
%
% \cs{href} tries to be clever and to detect from the argument
% if a url or a file link or a launch command should be created.
%
% The rules are not trivial, and they make the code complicated.
% This detection also makes it more difficult to handle special cases
% like non-ascii input for the link types.
%
% For this reason three new commands have been create:
%
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \cs{hrefurl} for standard urls (and non-pdf files)
% \item \cs{hrefpdf} for references to pdf files
% \item \cs{hrefrun} for launch links
% \end{itemize}
%
% The new commands don't use prefixes like \cs{href}.
% Their argument should be the real content.
%
% \subsection{Options}
% All \cs{href} commands and \cs{url} have an option argument for keyval syntax.
% It accepts the following keys. Not all keys make sense for all keys, but they don't
% error, they are silently ignored. The optional argument can currently not be used together
% with the \cs{urldef} command.
%
% \begin{tabular}{llp{6cm}}
% key & applicable commands  & note\\\hline
% urlencode & \cs{hrefurl}   & if set the code will convert the argument to percent encoding. This allows non-ascii input.\\
% protocol &  \cs{hrefurl}, \cs{url} & This sets a prefix/protocol that is added to the url, see below. \\
% format   & \cs{url}   & a command used to format the printed text. It replaces the standard \cs{Url}. This can improve non-ascii
% typesetting at the cost of losing the special line breaking.\\
% destination &  \cs{href}, \cs{hrefpdf} & A destination name in the PDF\\
% page & \cs{href}, \cs{hrefpdf}        & destination page, default: 1\\
% pdfremotestartview &\cs{href}, \cs{hrefpdf} & start view, default: Fit\\
% ismap & \cs{href}, \cs{hrefurl}       & see PDF reference\\
% afrelationship &  \cs{href}, \cs{hrefpdf} & Changes the /AFRelationship key of the filespec dictionary. The value should be a PDF name without the starting slash.\\
% run-parameter & \cs{hreflaunch} & run parameter (see the PDF reference)\\
% nextactionraw & various & puts a /Next entry in the action dictionary (see the PDF reference)\\
% \end{tabular}
%
%
% The first four keys can be set also in \cs{hypersetup} for all following commands in
% the current group through the keys
% \texttt{href/urlencode}, \texttt{href/protocol}, \texttt{href/destination}, \texttt{href/format}.
%
% It is possible to define own url commands with specific options e.g. with
%
% \begin{verbatim}
% \NewDocumentCommand\myurl{O{}}{\url[protocol=https://,format=\textsc,#1]}
% \end{verbatim}
%
%  \section{Link decorations: border, color, OCG-color, \ldots}
%  Some main changes are
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item The default colors have been changed.
%  \item Citations have by default no special color, they are
%  colored like other internal links. You can use |citecolor| and |citebordercolor| to
%  assign them a special color. This color is not reset if you use |allcolors| or
%  switch to another color scheme. If you want the colors to follow |linkcolor| again
%  you should remove the label |hyp/cite| and/or |hyp/citeborder|
%  from the hook |hyp/link/cite|.
%  \item a number of color schemes have been predefined.
%  \end{itemize}
%
%  \subsection{Background information}
%  With the standard drivers \pkg{hyperref} allows either to color the link text,
%  or to use a border around it.
%  There is also a (rather unknown) option |frenchlinks| to use small caps
%  for some links instead of colors.
%
%  The \emph{link border} is a setting in the PDF annotation directory.
%  It can be colored and styled (with the |<xxx>bordercolor|, |pdfborderstyle|
%  and |pdfhighlight| keys), but the exact look depends on the PDF viewer.
%  Such decorations are normally not  printed.
%
%  The \emph{link text} is colored with the standard color commands for text.
%  Such a color is also printed, which is often not wanted. The printing
%  can be avoided in PDF with so-called OCG-layers: They allow to add
%  variants of a text along with instructions which variant should be used for
%  viewing and which for printing. \pkg{hyperref} implements a rather simple version
%  for links: The link text is put in a box and printed twice with different colors
%  on different OCG layers. As boxes are used such links can't be broken. The
%  package \pkg{ocgx2} implements a more sophisticated version which allows to
%  use it for links broken over lines and pages.
%
%  \pkg{hyperref} has keys to set the color and border for |link|, |url|, |file|,
%  |menu| and |run| types. They correspond to the PDF annotation types
%  |GoTo|, |URI|, |GoToR|, |Named| and |Launch|.
%  Beside this there is a |anchorcolor| which isn't used at all, and |citecolor|
%  which is a semantical category and doesn't fit to the other types.
%
%  In the standard drivers the decoration options are more or less exclusive and global:
%  One of the options (|colorlinks|, |ocgcolorlinks|, or borders) has to be
%  chosen in the preamble and is then used for the whole document
%  and all link types.
%  Only colors and eventually the border style can be adjusted locally.
%  But there is no technical reason for these restrictions:
%  It is quite possible to change all these attributes
%  at any time both by link type and locally. The restrictions of the current
%  implementation can only be explained by the age of the code: \pkg{hyperref}
%  has been created at a time when memory was small and the main drivers were html
%  and postscript based.
%
%  While link colors have been traditionally more or less
%  under the control of \pkg{hyperref},
%  the situation with other format options, like the font, is more complicated.
%  The font in \cs{url} is for example determined by \cs{Urlfont},
%  a command from the \pkg{url} package.
%  In the case of internal (GoTo) references packages like \pkg{cleveref} or
%  \pkg{biblatex} or  \pkg{glossaries} offer formatting options too.
%  Formatting here is often connected to semantics:
%  an acronym should use a different font than a citation.
%  While \pkg{hyperref} could offer options here, it would probably only clash
%  with package formatting. It is more sensible not to interfere here. For this
%  reason the |frenchlinks| option has been dropped.
%
%  \subsection{New Keys}
%  Some of the existing keys have been extended to allow individual setting for
%  the link types |link|, |url|, |file| |menu| and |run|:
%
%  \begin{itemize}
%   \item Beside |pdfborder| there are also |linkborder|, |urlborder| etc
%   \item Beside |pdfhighlight| there are also |linkhighlight|, |urlhighlight| etc
%   \item Beside |pdfborderstyle| there are also |linkborderstyle|, |urlborderstyle| etc
%   \item Beside |colorlinks| there are also |colorlink|, |colorurl| etc
%   \item Beside |ocgcolorlinks| there are also |ocgcolorlink|, |ocgcolorurl|, etc %TODO
%   \item Beside |hidelinks| there are also |hidelink|, |hideurl|, etc
%   \item |bordercolormodel| allows to set the model used in annotations,
%   the allowed values  are |rgb| or |cmyk|. |rgb| is the default.
%   It does \emph{not} change the model of text colors. Be aware
%   that while the PDF format allows cmyk (4 numbers) in the |/C| key of an annotation,
%   this is often ignored by pdf viewers and the colors can be wrong.
%   \item The boolean keys |url|, |link|, |run|, |menu|, |file| allow to deactivate
%   locally the link types.
%  \end{itemize}
%
%   \begin{hypkey}{colorscheme}
%
%   The new key |colorscheme| allows to switch the colors (both for text and borders)
%   with a key word. It takes one of the values
%   |primary-colors| (the colors as \pkg{hyperref} uses normally), |phelype|, |daleif|,
%   |szabolcsA|, |szabolcsB|, |tivv|, |julian|, |henryford|.
%
%   The names refer to the authors in answers and comments in
%   \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/525261/better-default-colors-for-hyperref-links}.
%
%   The default is |phelype|.
%   \end{hypkey}
%
%  \subsection{Public interfaces}
%  The |colorlinks| and |ocgcolorlinks| and related keys are
%  using these booleans:
%  \begin{verbatim}
%     \l_hyp_annot_colorlink_bool,
%     \l_hyp_annot_colorurl_bool,
%     \l_hyp_annot_colorfile_bool,
%     \l_hyp_annot_colorrun_bool,
%     \l_hyp_annot_colormenu_bool,
%     \l_hyp_annot_ocgcolorlink_bool,
%     \l_hyp_annot_ocgcolorurl_bool,
%     \l_hyp_annot_ocgcolorfile_bool,
%     \l_hyp_annot_ocgcolorrun_bool,
%     \l_hyp_annot_ocgcolormenu_bool,
%  \end{verbatim}
%
%   They are both inserting hook code in the |pdfannot/link/|\meta{type}|/begin|
%   and |pdfannot/link/|\meta{type}|/end| hooks. \meta{type} is one of
%   |GoTo|, |URI|, |GoToR|, |Named| or |Launch|.
%
%   |colorlinks| uses the label |hyp/color|, and |ocgcolorlinks| the label |hyp/ocg|.
%
%   They both use the same color names: |hyp/color/link|, |hyp/color/url|,
%   |hyp/color/file|, |hyp/color/run|, |hyp/color/menu|.
%
%   The cite colors uses the names |hyp/color/cite| and |hyp/color/citeborder|.
%
%   The border colors aren't saved in color names currently, but if the need
%   would arise it would possible to change this.
%  \subsection{Changed behaviour}
%   \begin{description}
%   \item[colorlinks] |colorlinks| will as before disable the |pdfborder|, but it is possible
%    to use the key in the document at any time, or to reenable the border if wanted.
%    Internally |colorlinks| \& friends will no longer define/undefine
%    |\Hy@colorlink|, but instead use the hooks provided by the \pkg{l3pdfannot} package.
%   \item Color keys accept the following input syntax:
%
%   \begin{tabular}{ll}
%    model based      & |urlbordercolor = [rgb]{1,1,0}| \\
%    color expression & |urlbordercolor =  red!50!blue| \\
%    command          & |urlbordercolor = \mycolor|
%   \end{tabular}
%
%    where |\mycolor| should expand to one of the other two syntax variants.
%
%   \item[frenchlinks] The option |frenchlinks| does nothing at all.
%   \item[cite colors] As mentioned above the support for |citecolor|
%   and |citebordercolor|   has been reduced. A package like \pkg{hyperref}
%   can't keep track of such semantic
%   contexts like cite, acronym, glossaries and special references and maintain keys for
%   them. The keys are not completly dropped as this would affect packages like
%   \pkg{natbib}, but they have been separated and are no longer affected by
%   group keys like |allcolors|  but must be set individually instead.
%
%   \item[link margin] The driver sets a default link margin---this is identical
%   to pdftex and luatex driver, but a change for the xetex and dvips driver.
%   The (undocumentated) command \cs{setpdflinkmargin} does nothing.
%   Use either the key |pdflinkmargin| or \cs{pdfannot_link_margin:n} to change the margin.
%   See also the description in section~\ref{sec:keydesc} and in the \pkg{hyperref} manual.
%   \end{description}
%
%  \section{PDF strings}
%
%  \pkg{hyperref} uses a command called \cs{pdfstringdef} to convert text input into
%  something that makes sense and is valid in a PDF string, e.g. in the bookmarks
%  or in the info dictionary or as form field values.
%
%  As the handling of the outlines are delegated to the \pkg{bookmark} package, they
%  will for now still use \cs{pdfstringdef}, but all other strings produced by
%  this driver will use a new method based on the expl3 commands
%  \cs{text_purify:n} and  \cs{str_set_convert:Nnnn}. For normal text
%  it shouldn't matter, but a variety of commands and math are handled differently.
%  Like with \cs{pdfstringdef} they are a number of ways to adjust the outcome of
% \cs{text_purify:n}. These are described in the expl3 documentation interface3.pdf.
%
% \emph{The new method is under heavy development!}
%
%  Important differences here are
%  \begin{itemize}
%    \item \emph{This new method requires that files are utf8-encoded}
%      (at least if non-ascii chars are used in for PDF strings).
%    \item \emph{All} robust commands are currently removed,
%     unless an equivalent has been  declared.
%    \item Currently the new method is much more silent: it doesn't warn like
%     \pkg{hyperref} if it removes commands.
%   \end{itemize}

% \section{Package options from hyperref}\label{sec:pkg-options}
%  The driver will process the package options at the end.
%  But normally options should better be set with \cs{hypersetup} after
%  the package has been loaded. This is also the case for options which normally
%  don't work in \cs{hypersetup}.
%  One option that currently doesn't work correctly as package option is
%  |ocgcolorlinks|
%
%
%  Options that still must be set as package options are
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item |backref|
%  \item |CJKbookmarks| this key should not be used anymore. At some time
%  it will be removed.
%  \item |destlabels|    (destination names are taken from \cs{label} if possible)
%  \item |encap|
%  \item |hyperfigures|  (according to the \pkg{hyperref} manual
%  it makes figures hyper links, but actually is a no-op for most drivers, and it
%  does nothing with this driver either.)
%  \item |hyperfootnotes|
%  \item |hyperindex|
%  \item |implicit|      (redefine \LaTeX\ internals)
%  \item |nesting| unneeded key, see comment below in \ref{sec:keydesc}. At some time
%  it will be either removed or extended (if some use can be found).
%  \item |pagebackref|
%  \item |pdfpagelabels| (set PDF page labels)
%  \item |psdextra| this loads some extra definitions used by \cs{pdfstringdef}.
%  The new driver uses \cs{pdfstringdef} only for the bookmarks, for other strings
%  it is not relevant.
%  \end{itemize}
%
%  Options that can be without problems set as package options are
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item |debug|, |verbose| (a boolean)
%  \item |bookmarks| (a boolean)
%  \item |plainpages|
%  \item |draft|, |final|
%  \item |hypertexnames|
%  \item |naturalnames|
%  \item |pageanchor|
%  \end{itemize}
%
%  Ignored options:
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item All driver options like |pdftex|, |dvipdfmx|, \ldots
%  \item |raiselinks| (only used in the dviwind, textures and tex4ht driver anyway)
%  \item |frenchlinks|
%  \item |setpagesize|
%  \item |addtopdfcreator|
%  \end{itemize}
%
%  \section{Disabling links}
%
%  \pkg{hyperref} knows like many packages the options |draft| and |final|.
%  With \pkg{hyperref} they can be used as package options or in the preamble
%  in \cs{hypersetup} and disable links and anchors completely.
%  The new driver passes the options also to the \pkg{bookmark} package if
%  \pkg{bookmark} hasn't been loaded yet as bookmarks can't work properly if
%  the anchors from \pkg{hyperref} are missing.
%
%  \DescribeHypkey{link}%
%  \DescribeHypkey{url}%
%  \DescribeHypkey{file}%
%  \DescribeHypkey{run}%
%  \DescribeHypkey{menu}%
%  The |draft| option is a global option that can't be undone (at least not easily).
%  So the new driver offers also boolean keys |link|, |url|, |file|, |run| and |menu|
%  which allow to locally disable a link type. So e.g.
%  |\hypersetup{link=false}\ref{abc}| will give a reference without link (this
%  is naturally also possible with |\ref*{abc}|). This disables also all hooks of
%  the link type, so the link is for example no longer colored. It also removes the
%  implicit grouping of the content.
%
%
%  \section{Draftmode}
%  pdftex and other engines knows a
%  draftmode which can be set with |\pdfdraftmode=1|
%  and \pkg{hyperref} honors this in some places. The new
%  driver ignores it, for example |pagelabels| are created in any case.
%  With today's computer power there is not much to gain and it only complicates
%  the code.
%
%  This should not be confused with the |draft| and |final| package options! They
%  are still honored.
%
%  \section{Dropped options}
%  A number of options are ignored by this driver
%  \begin{description}
%  \item[pdfversion] The pdfversion should be set in \cs{DocumentMetadata}
%  \item[setpagesize] The key is ignored and the PDF page size is not
%  set. Load \pkg{color} or \pkg{graphicx} or use a class which sets the PDF page size.
%  \item[breaklinks] The option does nothing sensible anyway (apart from triggering
%  a warning). Currently with latex+dvips links can't be broken. But there is work
%  in progress to change this.
%  \item[unicode] This is always true.
%  \item[pdfa] If this option is set to true \pkg{hyperref} normally checks and sets
%  a small number of requirements for the PDF standard PDF/A.
%  The key is ignored with this driver. Instead the wanted standard should be declared
%  in \cs{DocumentMetadata}:
%  \begin{verbatim}
%  \DocumentMetadata{pdfstandard=A-2b}
%  \end{verbatim}
%  Currently |A-1b|, |A-2b|, |A-3b| can be set.
%  The support for various requirements is still incomplete, but the parts that
%  \pkg{hyperref} checked are implemented:
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item The |/F| key is added to links and |Print| is activated, |Hidden|, |Invisible|,
%   |NoView| are deactivated.
%  \item |/NeedAppearances| is suppressed
%  \item  Pushbuttons, which use the action |/S/JavaScript| are suppressed.
%  \item  Resetbuttons, which use the action |/S/ResetForm| are suppressed.
%  \item  In widget annotations, the /AA dictionary is suppressed.
%  \end{itemize}
%  \end{description}
%  \section{Destinations}
%  Destinations (sometimes call anchors in the \pkg{hyperref} documentation)
%  are the places a link jumped too. Unlike the name may suggest they don't described
%  an exact location in the PDF. Instead a destination contains a reference to
%  a page along with an instruction how to display this page.
%  The normally used \enquote{XYZ \textit{top left zoom}} for example instructs
%  the viewer to show the page with the given \textit{zoom} and
%  the top left corner at the \textit{top left} coordinates---which then gives
%  the impression that there is an anchor at this position.
%
%  From these instructions two (|Fit| and |FitB|) don't take an argument.
%  All  others take one (|FitH|, |FitV|, |FitBH|, |FitBV|)
%  or more (|XYZ|, |FitR|) arguments. These arguments are normally
%  coordinates, |XYZ| takes also a zoom factor. The coordinates are
%  absolute coordinates in |bp| relative to the lower left corner
%  of the PDF.
%
%  With the primitive command \cs{pdfdest} of pdftex almost all instructions are created
%  with a keyword only: The needed coordinate is calculated automatically from the location
%  the \cs{pdfdest} command is issued. So to get a specific coordinate one has to
%  move the command to the right place. E.g.
%  \begin{verbatim}
%  \AddToHookNext{shipout/background}
%     {\put(0,-\pdfpageheight+100bp){\pdfdest name{destA} FitH\relax}}
%  \end{verbatim}
%
%  Exceptions are the |XYZ| instruction, where pdftex accepts a keyword
%  |zoom| followed by a zoom factor, and the |FitR| instruction
%  which understands the keywords |width|, |height| and |depth|
%  followed by a dimension, which is then used to calculate a rectangle relative to the
%  current location. If no keywords are given the dimensions are taken from the surrounding
%  box---which can also lead to zero sized areas.
%
%  The manual of \pkg{hyperref} gives a bit the impression as if this
%  coordinates can be set manually by the user but as described above this is
%  mostly wrong: It is for normal destination only possible with a dvi-backend like
%  dvips which make use of |pdfmark.def|. pdftex and luatex can use manual coordinates
%  only for |pdfstartview| and |pdfremotestartview|.
%  As dvips was the first driver of \pkg{hyperref} the option |pdfview| was at first
%  developed for it and then adapted to pdftex. But this had the effect that the handling
%  of the option |pdfview| is inconsequent across the backend and engines:
%  For example with |pdfview=FitH 100| pdftex ignores the
%  number and calculates its own, while dvips sets the coordinate to the absolute
%  100. The zoom factor of |XYZ| is not supported by the pdftex driver at all, and
%  |FitR| only partially.
%
%  The generic driver consolidate this but tries to stay compatible with the other
%  drivers as far as possible.
%  It also takes into account that |pdfview| and |pdfstartview| and |pdfremotestartview|
%  have different requirements: While for the first relative coordinates are fine,
%  for the two others absolute coordinates are more sensible.
%
%  \DescribeHypkey{pdfview}
%  \DescribeHypkey{pdfstartview}
%  \DescribeHypkey{pdfremotestartview}
%  So with this driver the options
%  |pdfview|, |pdfstartview| and |pdfremotestartview| take
%  the following options:
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item |Fit|, |FitB|, |FitH|, |FitV|,
%   |FitBH|, |FitBV| which can be followed by a positive integer (separated by a space) or the
%   keyword |null|.
%   The number can be gives as a \meta{dimension expression} surrounded with
%   \cs{hypercalcbp}. The driver redefines this command to use
%   \cs{dim_to_decimal_in_bp:n}.
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item |pdfview| will ignore the integer and any other arguments and calculate
%   the expected coordinates as described above for pdftex with all
%   supported engines and backends.
%   \item |pdfstartview| and |pdfremotestartview| will pass the optional
%   number or keyword after expansion as absolute coordinate. Missing numbers will
%   be filled up with |null|.
%   \end{itemize}
%
%  \item |XYZ|. This can be followed (separated by spaces) by up to three
%  positive integers or keywords |null| which are then taken as \textit{top left zoom}
%  in this order. \textit{zoom} is a factor, so e.g. 0.5 will give a scaling of 50\%.
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item |pdfview| will use the last value as \textit{zoom}, ignore all other values
%   and calculate  the expected coordinates as described above for pdftex with all
%   supported engines and backends (this means it is possible to use |XYZ 2| to
%   set a zoom of 200\%, it is not necessary to fill in dummy values.)
%   \item |pdfstartview| and |pdfremotestartview| will pass the optional
%   numbers or keyword after expansion as absolute coordinates and zoom.
%   Missing numbers will  be filled up with |null|.
%   \end{itemize}
%   This new behaviour is in part incompatible with previous handling with the dvips driver.
%
%
%  \item |FitR|.
%  If no argument (separated by spaces) follows then
%  |pdfview| will use with pdftex and luatex
%  the automatic calculation of the coordinates from the encompassing box. With
%  dvips and (x)dvipdfmx  it will fall back to |Fit|.
%  |pdfstartview| and |pdfremotestartview| will fallback to |Fit| too.
%
%  If arguments (separated by spaces) follow they should be
%  four numbers  representing \texttt{left bottom right top}.
%  \begin{itemize}\item
%  |pdfview| will use the values to calculate coordinates relative to the current
%  location. So |0 -100 200 400| will give a \enquote{box} of width 200bp,
%  height 400bp and depth 100dp that the destination should encompass.
%  Missing numbers will be set to 0. But one should be aware that is it is quite
%  unpredicable how viewers which support |FitR| handles zero sizes.
%
%  \item |pdfstartview| and |pdfremotestartview| will pass
%  the values as absolute coordinates.
%  \end{itemize}
%  \end{itemize}
%
% \subsection{Names of destinations}
% hyperref creates two types of destination names: For numbered structures
% (so when the anchor is set by \cs{refstepcounter}) it builds the name
% from the counter name and the \cs{theH...} representation: |<counter name>.\theH<counter name>|.
%
% For unnumbered structures, e.g. starred chapters or anchors created with \cs{phantomsection}
% it uses names like |section*.<number>| and |chapter*.<number>|.
%
% Typically the name of destination can be retrieved by setting a label, this works also
% with unnumbered sections.
% The anchor and also the page can be retrieve in an expandable way
% with the help of commands from the
% \pkg{refcount} package which is loaded by hyperref. For example with the
% following commands it is possible to use the label to create a bookmark:
%
% \begin{verbatim}
% \bookmark[dest=\getrefbykeydefault{label}{anchor}{Doc-Start}]{my bookmark}
% \bookmark[dest=page.\getrefbykeydefault{label}{page}{Doc-Start}]{my bookmark}
% \end{verbatim}
%
% If  a \cs{HyperDestNameFilter} is defined, this must be added around the definition,
% so actually the full code has to look like this
% \begin{verbatim}
% \bookmark[dest=
%  \HyperDestNameFilter{\getrefbykeydefault{label}{anchor}{Doc-Start}}]{mysection}
% \end{verbatim}
% To simplify this hyperref provides |\hyperget{anchor}{label}| and
% |\hyperget{pageanchor}{label}|
%
%\section{Assorted key descriptions}\label{sec:keydesc}
%The following gives a few details to some keys that are perhaps not
%completly described in the manual, or are a bit different in this driver.
%The list is alphabetic.
%
% \DescribeHypkey{bookmarkstype} This key takes as value the extension of a list
% like |toc| or |lof|. If this list uses \cs{addcontentsline} the content will
% be added to the bookmarks. The key can be use in \cs{hypersetup} and also in
% the middle of the document to switch the list.
%
% \DescribeHypkey{bordercolormodel} With |bordercolormodel| the colormodel used in the |/C|
% key of the annotation array and in similar keys is set. It does not affect
% the text and graphics colors in the page stream.
% Possible choices are |rgb| (three numbers in the array) and |cmyk| (four numbers).
% While the PDF reference allows four numbers, PDF readers don't necessarly handle
% this correctly, so the value can be wrong.
%
% \DescribeHypkey{destlabel} This is a boolean key. Currently it must be set
% as package option. If set to true, the name
% of a destination is taken from a following \cs{label}, if there is one before
% the next destination command. This requires two compilations to get
% the correct coordinates in the destination. In the first compilation
% the alias name is recorded in the aux-file:
% \begin{verbatim}
% \hyper@newdestlabel{section.1.2}{sec:sec2}
% \end{verbatim}
% The next compilation can then make use of it.
% The two-pass could be avoided in the future with a better labeling system,
% where the name if set earlier.
%
% \DescribeHypkey{extension} This key sets an variable that has two purposes:
% It is used if file name has not extension, and it decides if the annotation
% is a URI or GoToR annotation. So
% \begin{verbatim}
% \hypersetup{extension=dvi}
% \href{mwe1.pdf}{pdf}
% \href{mwe2.dvi}{dvi}
% \href{mwe3}{no ext}
% \end{verbatim}
% will create
% \begin{verbatim}
% /Subtype/Link/A<</S/URI   /URI(mwe1.pdf)>>
% /Subtype/Link/A<</S/GoToR /F  (mwe2.dvi)>>
% /Subtype/Link/A<</S/GoToR /F  (mwe3.dvi)>>
% \end{verbatim}
% Typically PDF viewer can handle only GoToR annotions pointing to a PDF.
% So normally the default value |pdf| of this key should not be changed.
% \DescribeHypkey{nesting}\label{key:nesting}%
% This key is useless in PDF context. The boolean is only used in
% the code for anchors/destination where nesting doesn't make sense.
% It should not be changed.
%
% \DescribeHypkey{pdfborder}\DescribeHypkey{linkborder}\DescribeHypkey{urlborder}
% \DescribeHypkey{runborder}\DescribeHypkey{menuborder}
% This key set accept as value three numbers or three numbers and an array describing
% a dash pattern, examples are |0 0 1| or |0 0 1 [3 2]|.
% The first two numbers should according to the reference set round
% corners, but PDF viewer seem to ignore it. The third number is the line width
% of the border. Settings done with |pdfborderstyle| should take precedence.
%
% \DescribeHypkey{pdfborderstyle}\DescribeHypkey{linkborderstyle}
% \DescribeHypkey{urlborderstyle}\DescribeHypkey{fileborderstyle}
% \DescribeHypkey{runborderstyle}\DescribeHypkey{menuborderstyle}
% The value of this key is the content of the |BS| dictionary.
% As an example |/Type/Border /W 1  /S/U  /D[3 2]|
%
% \begin{tabular}{>{\ttfamily} lll}
% Key & Values & comment / example\\\hline
% /Type & |/Border| & optional \\
% /W    & \meta{number} & Width of border line \\
% /S    & |/S|      & solid (default)\\
%       & |/D| &dash  pattern can be set with /D\\
%       & |/B| & beveled\\
%       & |/I| & inset\\
%       & |/U| & underline\\
% /D    & \meta{array of numbers} & dash pattern (lines/gaps) (default [3])
% \end{tabular}
%
% \DescribeHypkey{pdfcreationdate}\DescribeHypkey{pdfmoddate}
% Setting these keys is normally not needed. If they are used the values
% are stored directly in the Info dictionary for |/Creationdate| and |/ModDate|.
% The values are converted to strings but not processed further, so they should
% have the correct PDF format without the enclosing parentheses,
% e.g. |D:20200202111111+01'00'|.
%
% \DescribeHypkey{pdflinkmargin}As described in the \pkg{hyperref} manual
% the behaviour differs between the backends: with dvips it is possible to
% change links locally, pdflatex and lualatex work by page, with dvipdfmx
% the setting is global (and has to be done in the preamble).
%
% \DescribeHypkey{pdflang} The key will work, but it is recommended to the set
% the language in \cs{DocumentMetadata} instead.

% \section{PDF string conversion}
%
% This defines a command which is used to replace
% \cs{pdfstringdef}. This is probably temporary and will be adjusted or
% replaced if some more generic PDF string command/module exists.
% All commands here use the \enquote{submodule} name \texttt{text}.
% At first a hook for user additions:
% \begin{macro}{hyp/text/pdfstring}
%    \begin{macrocode}
\hook_new:n {hyp/text/pdfstring}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% The first step to convert input in a PDF string is to purify it, that means
% to remove/expand commands. As the whole process is not expandable anyway we
% can use a protected command. The \enquote{output} is a string:
% \begin{macro}{\@@_text_purify:nN}
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_protected:Npn \@@_text_purify:nN #1 #2 %#1 input, #2  str command
  {
     \str_set:Nx #2 {\text_purify:n { #1 } }
  }
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% The second step is to cleanup the output of the first step. This is a dummy
% currently. The argument should be a string variable.
% \begin{macro}{\@@_text_cleanup:N}
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_protected:Npn \@@_text_cleanup:N #1
 {

 }
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% The last step converts the string to a PDF encoding. As we have at least two
% targets (hex and literal) there is an argument. The conversion assumes
% utf8 input, it is based on cs{pdf_string_from_unicode:nnN} in l3pdftools.
%
% \#2 is str variable,
% \#1 should be one of
%
% \begin{tabular}{ll}
%  utf8/string         & \texttt{(lit)} (utf8/string)\\
%  utf8/string-raw     & \texttt{lit}   (utf8/string)\\

%  utf8/URI-raw         & \texttt{percent encoded url}\\
%  utf16/hex            & \texttt{<HEX>} (utf16/hex)\\
%  utf16/hex-raw           & \texttt{HEX}   (utf16/hex)\\
%  utf16/string        & \texttt{(lit)} (utf16/string)\\

% \section{Pagelabels}
% Page labels are representations of the page numbers in the PDF viewer. If the hyperref
% options |pdfpagelabels| is true (the default) roman numbers are e.g. shown as
% \enquote{ii (2/58)}. To do this the page ranges must be collected, if possible a prefix
% and the numbering of the counter must be identified and then written
% to the catalog.
%
% The current implementation in hyperref/hyperref drivers:
% \begin{description}
% \item[xetex:] hxetex.def, line 80-110\\
%        |\HyPL@StorePageLabel| writes to the aux-file
%        at begin document (after reading the aux)
%        |\HyPL@SetPageLabels| is called (defined in hyperref.sty after the driver
%        loading)
%        which calls |\Hy@PutCatalog{/PageLabels<</Nums[\HyPL@Labels]>>}|
% \item[dvips:]  identical to xetex, line 60 to 90 in pdfmark.def
% \item[dvipdfm:] identical to xetex
% \item[pdftex:] |\HyPL@StorePageLabel| stores in |\HyPL@Labels| in the first compilation
% In |\AtVeryEndDocument|  |\HyPL@SetPageLabels| is called.
% \item[luatex] identical to pdftex
% \end{description}
%
% The code in \pkg{hyperref} inspects |\thepage| and tries to figure out
% the numbering system and the prefix. E.g. A-\arabic{page} is correctly split.
% If the counter can not be identified \pkg{hyperref} generates only /P entries with the
% whole content.
%
% The new implementation makes use of the pdf management: The relevant entry in the
% catalog is continuously updated and pushed out at the end of the document.
% This works (hopefully \ldots) with all drivers.
%
% We do not try to avoid the (in hyperref's wording)
% \enquote{useless} pagelabel entry
% |/PageLabels <</Nums[0<</S/D>>]>>|
% (but it would be possible), we also don't test for empty |\thepage|,
% \pkg{hyperref} seems to handle this fine and the pdf is valid.
%
% The code has to define |\Hy@PutCatalog| as we can't yet
% change code in hyperref. The switch for draftmode has been removed.
%
% \begin{macro}
%   {
%     \@@_PageLabels_gpush:,
%     \Hy@PutCatalog,
%     \HyPL@StorePageLabel

  }
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \section {Core Hyperref Commands}
% Every \pkg{hyperref} has to define eight core command:
% \begin{verbatim}
% \hyper@anchor
% \hyper@anchorstart
% \hyper@anchorend
% \hyper@link      %GoTo
% \hyper@linkstart %GoTo
% \hyper@linkend   %GoTo
% \hyper@linkfile  %GoToR
% \hyper@linkurl   %URI
% \end{verbatim}
%
% This driver defines for consistency also
% |\hyper@linklaunch| for Launch and |\hyper@linknamed| for Named.
%
% \subsection{ Anchors / destinations}
% The first three commands are needed for \enquote{anchors}. At first
% the internal commands to create a destination. It uses
% |\Hy@WrapperDef| to make it babel safe, it is not clear if this is
% still needed, but we leave if for now.
% \begin{function} { \@@_destination:nn }
% \begin{syntax}
%  \cs{@@_destination:nn} \Arg{destination name} \Arg{location}
%  \end{syntax}
%  The \meta{destination name} is encoded with the method stored in
%  in \cs{l_@@_text_enc_dest_tl}. The location should be one of
%  |fit|, |fith|, |fitv|, |fitbv|, |fitbh|, |fitr|, |xyz|, |fitrbx|.
%  The last will make use of \cs{l_@@_dest_box}
% \end{function}
% \begin{macro}{ \@@_destination:nn }
%    \begin{macrocode}
\Hy@WrapperDef \@@_destination:nn #1 #2
  {
    \mode_if_horizontal:T { \@savsf\spacefactor }
    \Hy@SaveLastskip      %defined in hyperref
    \Hy@VerboseAnchor{#1} %defined in hyperref, for debugging
    \@@_text_pdfstring:xoN
      { \HyperDestNameFilter{#1}  }
      { \l_@@_text_enc_dest_tl }
      \l_@@_tmpa_tl
    \str_if_eq:nnTF  {#2} {fitrbox}
      {
        \exp_args:NV
        \pdf_destination:nnnn \l_@@_tmpa_tl
         { \box_wd:N \l_@@_dest_box }
         { \box_ht:N \l_@@_dest_box }
         { \box_dp:N \l_@@_dest_box }
      }
      {
        \exp_args:NV
          \pdf_destination:nf
          { \l_@@_tmpa_tl }
          { #2 }
      }
    \Hy@RestoreLastskip   %defined in hyperref
    \mode_if_horizontal:T { \spacefactor\@savsf }
  }
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% This are the three destinations commands. They are modelled along the
% xetex version. It is not quite clear if really all three
% are needed for the backends supported by this driver, but changing the hyperref
% code would be difficult.
% We add a hook. This allows e.g. the tagging code
% to create also a structured destination.
% We don't use the cmd hook, as we want the same hook for both start commands.
% We make the current dest name available so that the hook code can use it.
%  \begin{macro}
%    {
%      \hyper@anchor,
%      \hyper@anchorstart,
%      \hyper@anchorend,
%      hyp/anchor,
%      \l_hyp_current_dest_name_tl
%    }

%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
% \subsection{GoTo Links}
% The next three commands are for links inside the document,
% to destinations (GoTo links).
% The definition in \pkg{hyperref} have a first argument which
% can be used to pass a semantical context. Currently this argument is
% only used for \cs{cite} and only to change the color. The new
% implementation uses it for a real hook.
%
% At first the internal link commands:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_protected:Npn \@@_link_goto_begin:nw #1
  {
    \mode_leave_vertical:
    \protected@edef \l_@@_dest_name_tmpa_tl { #1 }
    \tl_if_empty:NTF \l_@@_dest_name_tmpa_tl
      {
        \msg_warning:nnx
          { hyp }
          { empty-destination-name }
          { \c_@@_dest_undefined_tl }
        \tl_set_eq:NN \l_@@_dest_name_tmpa_tl \c_@@_dest_undefined_tl
      }
      {
        \@@_text_pdfstring:xoN
          { \exp_args:No \HyperDestNameFilter { \l_@@_dest_name_tmpa_tl } }
          { \l_@@_text_enc_dest_tl }
          \l_@@_dest_name_tmpa_tl
      }
    \exp_args:No
      \pdfannot_link_goto_begin:nw  { \l_@@_dest_name_tmpa_tl }
  }

\cs_new_protected:Npn \@@_link_goto_end:
  {
    \pdfannot_link_goto_end:
  }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% Now the three \pkg{hyperref} commands.
% The splitted commands \cs{hyper@linkstart} and \cs{hyper@linkend} are used for
% footnotemarks, toc and natbib-cites.
% \begin{function}{\hyper@link}
% \begin{syntax}
%  \cs{hyper@link}\Arg{context}\Arg{destination name}\Arg{link text}
% \end{syntax}
% This creates a complete GoTo link around the \meta{link text}
% pointing to \meta{destination name}.
% The hook |hyp/link/|\meta{context} is executed at the begin if it exists.
%
% The only \meta{context} for which a hook is predefined is |cite|.
% Packages which want to use another \meta{context} should initialize the hook like
% this:
% \begin{verbatim}
% \IfHookExistsTF{hyp/link/context}{}
%   {\NewHook{hyp/link/context}}
% \end{verbatim}
%
%  The hook code is executed in a group but before all the pdfannot hooks.
% \end{function}
% \begin{function}{\hyper@linkstart,\hyper@linkend}
% \begin{syntax}
%  \cs{hyper@linkstart}\Arg{context}\Arg{destination name}\\
%  \cs{hyper@linkend}
% \end{syntax}
% This creates the start and end commands for a GoTo link around the text
% between both pointing to \meta{destination name}.
% The hook |hyp/link/|\meta{context} is executed at the begin if it exists
% as with \cs{hyper@link}
%
% The commands open and close a group, so should be placed carefully. .
% \end{function}

% \pkg{hyperref} adds a group with \cs{Hy@colorlink}, we move this outside the link
% so that it groups the context hook too. We store again the destination name in the
% public tl |\l_hyp_current_dest_name_tl| so that the hook code can make use of
% it

% Transition settings are used by (some) pdf viewers when presenting a
% pdf in full screen mode. They are added to the page settings and describe the
% transition from the previous page to current page. Transition setting can be
% set in the preamble for all pages or in the document for the current and the
% following pages. Due to the asynchronous page breaking one has to be careful
% to set it on the right page, e.g. only after a |\newpage|.
% The generic driver uses a different syntax than the other \pkg{hyperref} drivers:
% various transition options can be set by a keyval syntax in the value of
% |pdfpagetransition|. A typical setting looks e.g. like this\\
% |\hypersetup{pdfpagetransition={style=Fly,duration=2,direction=90,opaque=false}}|
%
% The keys allowed in the argument of |pdfpagetransition| are
% 
% \begin{tabular}{l>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{6cm}}
% style    &  one of Split, Blinds, Box, Wipe, Dissolve, Glitter, R, Fly, Push, Cover, Uncover, Fade\\
