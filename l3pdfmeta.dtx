% \section{\pkg{l3pdfmeta} documentation}
% This module sets up some tools and commands needed
% for PDF standards in general.
% The goal is to collect the requirements and to provide code to check and fulfill them.
%
%
% \subsection{Verifying requirements of PDF standards}
%
% Standards like pdf/A set requirements on a PDF: Some things have be in the PDF,
% e.g. the catalog has to contain a /Lang entry and an colorprofile and
% an /OutputIntent, some other things are forbidden or restricted, e.g.
% the action dictionary of an annotation should not contain Javascript.
%
% The \pkg{l3pdfmeta} module collects a number of relevant requirements,
% tries to enforce the ones which can be enforced and offers some tools
% for package authors to test if an action is allowed in the standard or not.
%
% This is work in progress and more tests will be added. But it should be noted
% that it will probably never be possible to prevent all forbidden actions
% or enforce all required ones or even to simply check all of them.
% The commands here don't replace a check with an external validator.
%
% Verifying against a PDF-standard involves two different task:
%
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Check if you are allowed to ignore the requirement.
%   \item Decide which action to take if the answer to the first question is NO.
% \end{itemize}
%
% The following conditionals address the first task. Because of the second task
% a return value |FALSE| means that the standard requires you to do some
% special action. |TRUE| means that you can ignore this
% requirement.\footnote{One could also make the logic the
% other way round---there are arguments for both---but I had to decide.}
%
% In most cases it only matters if a requirement is in the standard,
% for example |Catalog_no_OCProperties| means \enquote{don't use |/OCProperties|
% in the catalog}. For a small number of requirements it is also needed to
% test a user value against a standard value. For example, |named_actions|
% restricts the allowed named actions in an annotation of subtype |/Named|,
% in this case it is needed to check not only if the requirement is
% in the standard but also if the user value is in the allowed list.
%
% \begin{function}[EXP,pTF]{\pdfmeta_standard_verify:n}
% \begin{syntax}
% \cs{pdfmeta_standard_verify:n}\Arg{requirement}
% \end{syntax}
%
% This checks if \meta{requirement} is listed in the standard.
% |FALSE| as result means that the requirement is in the standard and
% that probably some special action is required---which one depends
% on the requirement, see the descriptions below.
% |TRUE| means that the requirement is not there and so no special
% action is needed.
% This check can be used for simple requirements where neither
% a user nor a standard value is of importance.
% \end{function}
%
% \begin{function}[TF]{\pdfmeta_standard_verify:nn}
% \begin{syntax}
% \cs{pdfmeta_standard_verify:nn}\Arg{requirement}\Arg{value}
% \end{syntax}
%
% This checks if \meta{requirement} is listed in the standard,
% if yes it tries to find a predefined test handler for
% the requirement and passes \meta{value} and the value recorded
% in the standard to it. The handler returns |FALSE| if some special
% action is needed (e.g. if \meta{value} violates the rule)
% and |TRUE| if no special action is needed. If no handler exists
% this commands works like \cs{pdfmeta_standard_verify:n}.
% \end{function}
%
% In some cases one needs to query the value in the standard,
% e.g. to correct a wrong minimal PDF version you need to know
% which version is required by |min_pdf_version|.
%  For this two commands to access the value are provided:
%
% \begin{function}[EXP]{\pdfmeta_standard_item:n}
% \begin{syntax}
% \cs{pdfmeta_standard_item:n}\Arg{requirement}
% \end{syntax}
% This retrieves the value of \meta{requirement} and leaves it in the input.
% If the requirement isn't in the standard the result is empty,
% that means that requirements not in the standard and
% requirement without values can not be distinguished here.
% \end{function}
%
%
% \begin{function}{\pdfmeta_standard_get:nN}
% \begin{syntax}
% \cs{pdfmeta_standard_get:nN}\Arg{requirement} \meta{tl var}
% \end{syntax}
% This retrieves the value of \meta{requirement} and stores
% it in the \meta{token list variable}.
% If the \meta{requirement} is not found the special
% value |\q_no_value| is used.
% The  \meta{token list variable} is assigned locally.
% \end{function}
%
%
% The following describe the requirements which can be currently tested.
% Requirements with a value should use \cs{pdfmeta_standard_verify:nn}
% or \cs{pdfmeta_standard_verify:nnN} to test a local value against the standard.
% The rule numbers refer to \url{https://docs.verapdf.org/validation/pdfa-part1/}
%
% \subsubsection{Simple tests without handler}
%
% \begin{description}
%
% \item[|outputintent_A|] requires to embed a color profile and
%  reference it in a /Outputintent and that all output intents reference
%  the same colorprofile. The value stores the subtype.
%  {\em This requirement is detected and fulfilled by \pkg{l3pdfmeta} if the
%   provided interface in \cs{DocumentMetadata} is used, see below}.
%
% \item[|annot_flags|] in annotations the |Print| flag should be true,
%  |Hidden|, |Invisible|, |NoView| should be false.
%  {\em This requirement is detected  and set by \pkg{l3pdfmeta} for annotations
%  created with the \pkg{l3pdfannot}.
%  A new check is only needed if the flags are changed
%  or if links are created by other means.}
%
% \item[|no_encryption|] don't encrypt
% \item[|no_external_content|] no |/F|, |/FFilter|, or |/FDecodeParms|
%  in stream dictionaries
% \item[|no_embed_content|]    no |/EF| key in filespec, no |/Type/EmbeddedFiles|.
%  \emph{This will be checked in future by \pkg{l3pdffiles}
%  for the files it embeds.}
%  The restrictment is set for only PDF/A-1b.
%  PDF/A-2b and PDF/A3-b lifted this restriction: PDF/A-2b allows
%  to embed other PDF documents conforming to either PDF/A-1 or PDF/A-2,
%  and PDF/A-3 allows any embedded files. I don't see a way to test the
%  PDF/A-2b requirement so currently it will simply allow everything. Perhaps
%  a test for at least the PDF-format will be added in future.
% \item[|Catalog_no_OCProperties|] don't add |/OCProperties| to the catalog
% {\em l3pdfmeta removes this entry at the end of the document}
% \item[|annot_widget_no_AA|] (rule 6.6.2-1)
%  no AA dictionary in widget annotation,
%  this will e.g. be checked by the new hyperref driver.
% \item[|annot_widget_no_A_AA|] (rule 6.9-2)  no A and AA dictionary in widget.
% \item[|form_no_AA|] (6.9-3)  no /AA dictionary in form field
% \item[|unicode|] that is set in the U-standards, A-2u and A-3u and means that
% every text should be in unicode. This is not something that can be enforced or
% tested from TeX, but in a current LaTeX normally ToUnicode are set for all fonts.
% \item[|tagged|] that is set in A-2a and A-3a and means that the pdf must be
% tagged. This is currently neither tested not enforced somewhere.
% \item[|Trailer_no_Info|] The \texttt{Info} dictionary
% has been deprecated since quite some time. Metadata should be set with
% XMP-data instead. In PDF A-4 now the \texttt{Info} dictionary
% shall not be present in the trailer dictionary at all
% (unless there exists a PieceInfo entry in the Catalog). And if it is present
% it should only contain the \texttt{/ModDate} entry. The engines
% do not offer currently an option to suppress the dictionary completly,
% one can only give the entries the value null (it only works for all entries
% with lualatex and pdflatex). The next pdflatex will offer \cs{pdfomitinfodict}.
% Until then l3pdfmeta does nothing with this requirement.
%
% \end{description}
%
% \subsubsection{Tests with values and special handlers}
%
% \begin{description}
%
% \item[|min_pdf_version|]  stores the minimal PDF version needed for
%  a standard.
%  It should be checked against the current PDF version (\cs{pdf_version:}).
%  A failure means that the version should be changed.
%  Currently there is only one hard requirement which leads to a failure in
%  a validator like verapdf: The A-4 standard should use PDF 2.0.
%  As PDF A-1 is based on PDF 1.4 and PDF A-2 and A-3 are based
%  on PDF 1.7 \pkg{l3pdfmeta} also sets these versions also as requirements.
%  These requirements are checked by \pkg{l3pdfmeta} when the version is set with
%  \cs{DocumentMetadata} and a warning is issued (but the version is
%  not changed). More checks are only needed if the version is changed later.
%
%
% \item[|max_pdf_version|]  stores the maximal PDF version.
%  It should be checked against the current PDF version (\cs{pdf_version:}).
%  A failure means that the version should be changed.
%  The check is currently relevant only for the A-1 to A-3 standards:
%  PDF 2.0 leads to a failure in a validator like verapdf so the maximal
%  version should be PDF 1.7.
%  This requirement is checked by \pkg{l3pdfmeta} when the version is set with
%  \cs{DocumentMetadata} and a warning is issued (but the version is
%  not changed). More checks are only needed if the version is changed later.
%
% \item[|named_actions|]    this requirement restricts the list of
% allowed named actions to |NextPage|, |PrevPage|, |FirstPage|, |LastPage|.
% The check should supply the named action without slash
% (e.g. |View| (failure) or |NextPage| (pass)).
%
% \item[|annot_action_A|] (rule 6.6.1-1) this requirement restricts
%  the allowed subtypes of the
% |/A| dictionary of an action. The check should supply the user
%  subtype without slash e.g. as |GoTo| (pass) or |Movie| (failure).
% \end{description}
%
% \subsection{Colorprofiles and OutputIntent}
%
% The pdf/A standards require that a color profile is embedded and
% referenced in the catalog in the |/OutputIntent| array.
%
% The problem is that the pdf/A standards also require, that if the PDF has more then
% one entry in the |/OutputIntent| array (which is allowed), their |/DestOutputProfile|
% should all reference the same color profile\footnote{see rule 6.2.2-2 at
% \url{https://docs.verapdf.org/validation/pdfa-part1/}}.
%
% Enforcing this fully is impossible if entries are added manually by users or
% packages with |\pdfmanagement_add:nnn {Catalog}{OutputIntents}{|\meta{object reference}|}|
% as it is difficult to inspect and remove entries from the |/OutputIntent| array.
%
% So we provide a dedicated interface to avoid the need of manual
% user settings and allow the code to handle the requirements of the standard.
% The interface doesn't handle yet all finer points for PDF/X standards, e.g.
% named profiles, it is meant as a starting point to get at least PDF/A validation
% here.
%
% \begin{NOTE}{UF}
% The interface has to handle the following points:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item  We have to assume that some documents wants to add more
%  than one OutputIntent with varying subtypes.
% \item While currently only |/GTS_PDFA1| and |/GTS_PDFX| seem to
% be relevant, we have to assume that the list of subtypes is open.
% \item But we can imho assume that every subtype is there at most once.
% \item The referenced color profile can be used also other means, e.g. an /ICCBased
% color space. We must avoid that it is embedded twice in this case.
% This will need coordination with l3color. It should probably provide the
% code to embed the profile.
% \item While we can predeclare some standard icc-profiles, an interface to
% setup more is needed. This is currently not handled, as it needs
% coordination with a setup in l3color too.
% \item The implementation doesn't really handle yet all finer points for pdf/X
% see \url{tn0002_color_in_pdfa-1_2008-03-141.pdf}
% \end{itemize}
% \end{NOTE}
% The interface looks like this
%
% \begin{verbatim}
%  \DocumentMetadata
%    {
%      %other options for example pdfstandard
%       colorprofiles=
%        {
%          A = sRGB.icc, %or a or longer GTS_PDFA1 = sRGB.icc
%          X = FOGRA39L_coated.icc, % or x or longer GTS_PDFX
%          ISO_PDFE1 = whatever.icc
%        }
%
%    }
% \end{verbatim}
%
% |sRGB.icc| and |FOGRA39L_coated.icc| (from the \pkg{colorprofiles} package
% are predefined and will work directly\footnote{The \texttt{dvips} route
% will require that \texttt{ps2pdf} is called with \texttt{-dNOSAFER},
% and that the color profiles are in the current folder as \texttt{ps2pdf} doesn't
% use \texttt{kpathsea} to find them.}. |whatever.icc| will need special setup in
% the document preamble to declare the values for the
% |OutputIntent| dictionary, but the interface hasn't be added yet. This will be
% decided later.
%
%
% If an A-standard is detected or set which requires
% that all |/DestOutputProfile| reference the same
% color profile, the setting is changed to the equivalent of
%
% \begin{verbatim}
%  \DocumentMetadata
%    {
%      %other options
%       pdfstandard=A-2b,
%       colorprofiles=
%        {
%          A = sRGB.icc, %or longer GTS_PDFA1 = sRGB.icc
%          X = sRGB.icc,
%          ISO_PDFE1 = sRGB.icc
%        }
%
%    }
% \end{verbatim}
%
% The pdf/A standards will use |A=sRGB.icc| by default, so this doesn't
% need to be declared explicitly.
%
% \subsection{Regression tests}
% When doing regression tests one has to set various metadata to fix values.

% \begin{function}{\pdfmeta_set_regression_data:}
% \begin{syntax}
% \cs{pdfmeta_set_regression_data:}
% \end{syntax}
% This sets various metadata to values needed by the \LaTeX{}
% regression tests.
% It also sets the seed for random functions.
% \end{function}
%
%  \section{XMP-metadata}
% XMP-metadata are data in XML format embedded in a stream
% inside the PDF and referenced from the |/Catalog|.
% Such a XMP-metadata stream contains various document related data,
% is required by various PDF standards and can replace
% or extend the data in the |/Info| dictionary.
% In PDF 2.0 the /Info dictionary is actually deprecated
% and only XMP-metadata should be used for the metadata of the PDF.
%
% The content of a XMP-metadata stream is not a fix set of data.
% Typically fields like the title, the author, the language and keywords will
% be there. But standards like e.g. ZUGferd (a standard for electronic bills)
% can require to add more fields, and it is also possible
% to define and add purely local data.
%
% In some workflows (e.g. if dvips + ghostscript is used)
% a XMP-metadata stream with some standard content is added automatically by
% the backend, but normally it must be created with code.
%
% For this task the packages \pkg{hyperxmp}, \pkg{xmpincl} or \pkg{pdfx}
% (which uses \pkg{xmpincl})
% can be used, but all these packages are not compatible with the
% pdfmanagement\footnote{\pkg{hyperxmp} was partly compatible as the pdfmanagement
% contained some patches for it, but these patches have now been removed.}.
% The following code is meant as replacement for these packages.
%
% \pkg{hyperxmp} uses |\hypersetup| as user interface to enter the XMP-metadata.
% This syntax is also supported by the new code\footnote{with a number of changes which
% are discussed in more details below}, so if \pkg{hyperref}
% has been loaded, e.g. |pdftitle=xxx| can be used to set the title.
% But XMP-metadata shouldn't require to use \pkg{hyperref} and in a future
% version an interface without \pkg{hyperref} will be added.
%
% There is currently no full user interface command to extend the XMP-metadata
% with for example the code needed for ZUGferd,
% they will be added in a second step.
%
% \subsection{Debug option}
%
% The resulting XMP-packet can be written to an external file by activating a debug
% option
%
% \begin{verbatim}
% \DocumentMetadata{debug={xmp-export}}
% %or
% \DocumentMetadata{debug={xmp-export=true}}
% %or
% \DocumentMetadata{debug={xmp-export=filename}}
% \end{verbatim}
%
% By default the data are written to \verb+\jobname.xmpi+, if a \texttt{filename} is
% given, then \verb+filename.xmpi+ is used instead. \verb+xmp-export=false+ deactivates
% the export.
%
% \subsection{Encoding and escaping}
%
% XMP-metadata are stored as UTF-8 in the PDF. This mean if you open a PDF in an editor
% a content like \enquote{grüße} will be shown probably as \enquote{grÃ¼ÃŸe}.
% As XMP-metadata are in XML format special chars like |<|, |>|, and |&| and
% \texttt{\textquotestraightdblbase} must be escaped.
%
% \pkg{hyperxmp} hooks into \pkg{hyperref} and passes all
% input through |\pdfstringdef|. This means a word like
% \enquote{hallo} is first converted by |\pdfstringdef| into\\
% |\376\377\000h\000a\000l\000l\000o| and then back to UTF-8 by
% \pkg{hyperxmp} and in the course of this action
% the XML-escapings are applied.
% \pkg{pdfx} uses |\pdfstringdef| together with
% a special fontencoding (similar to the PU-encoding of \pkg{hyperref})
% for a similar aim.
% The code here is based on |\text_purify:n| followed by a few replacements for the
% escaping.
%
% User data should normally be declared in the preamble (or even in the
% |\DocumentMetadata| command), and consist of rather simple text; |&| can be entered
% as |\&| (but directly |&| will normally work too),
% babel shorthands should not be used. Some datas are interpreted as comma lists,
% in this cases commas which are part of the text should be protected by braces.
% In some cases a text in brackets like |[en]| is interpreted as language tag,
% if they are part of a text they should be protected by braces too.
% XMP-metadata are stored uncompressed in the PDF so if you are unsure
% if a value has
% been passed correctly, open the PDF in an editor, copy the whole block and
% pass it to a validator, e.g. \url{https://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/}.
%
% \subsection{User interfaces and differences to \pkg{hyperxmp} }
%
% \subsubsection{PDF standards}
%
% The \pkg{hyperxmp}/\pkg{hyperref} keys |pdfapart|, |pdfaconformance|, |pdfuapart|,
% |pdfxstandard| and |pdfa| are ignored by this code. Standards must be set with the
% |pdfstandard| key of |\DocumentMetadata|. This key can be used more than once,
% e.g. \\
% |pdfstandard=A-2b,pdfstandard=X-4,pdfstandard=UA-1|.
% \\ Note that using these
% keys doesn't mean that the document actually follows the standard. \LaTeX{}
% can neither ensure nor check all requirements of a standard, and not everything
% it can do theoretically has already been implemented.
% When setting an |A| standard, the code will e.g. insert a color profile and
% warn if the PDF version doesn't fit, but |X| and |UA| currently only
% adds the relevant declarations to the XMP-metadata.
% It is up to the author to ensure and validate
% that the document actually follows the standard.
%
% \subsubsection{Dates}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
% The dates |xmp:CreateDate|, |xmp:ModifyDate|, |xmp:MetadataDate|
% are normally set automatically to the current date/time when the compilation
% started. If they should be changed
% (e.g. for regression tests to produce reproducible documents) they can
% be set with |\hypersetup| with the keys
% |pdfcreationdate|, |pdfmoddate| and |pdfmetadate|.
%
% \begin{verbatim}
% \hypersetup{pdfcreationdate=D:20010101205959-00'00'}
% \end{verbatim}
%
% The format should be a full date/time in PDF format, so one of these (naturally
% the numbers can change):
% \begin{verbatim}
%  D:20010101205959-00'00'
%  D:20010101205959+00'00'
%  D:20010101205959Z
% \end{verbatim}
%
% \item The date |dc:date| is an \enquote{author date} and so
% should normally be set to the same date as
% given by |\date|. This can be done  with the key |pdfdate|\footnote{Extracting
% the value automatically from \texttt{\textbackslash date} is not really possible
% as authors often put formatting or additional info in this command.}.
% The value should be a date in ISO 8601 format:
%
% \begin{verbatim}
% 2022             %year
% 2022-09-04       %year-month-day
% 2022-09-04T19:20 %year-month-day hour:minutes
% 2022-09-04T19:20:30 % year-month-day hour:minutes:second
% 2022-09-04T19:20:30.45 % year-month-day hour:minutes:second with fraction
% 2022-09-04T19:20+01:00 % with time zone designator
% 2022-09-04T19:20-02:00 % time zone designator
% 2022-09-04T19:20Z      % time zone designator
% \end{verbatim}
%
% It is also possible to give the date as a full date in PDF format as described
% above. If not set the current date/time is used.
%\end{itemize}
%
% \subsection{Language}
% The code assumes that a default language is always declared
% (as the pdfmanagement gives the |/Lang| entry in the catalog a default value)
% This language can be changed with the |\DocumentMetadata| key |lang| (preferred)
% but the \pkg{hyperref} key |pdflang| is also honored. Its value should be a
% simple language tag like |de| or |de-DE|.
%
% The main language is also used in a number of attributes in the XMP data,
% if wanted a different language can be set here with the
% \pkg{hyperref}/\pkg{hyperxmp} key |pdfmetalang|.
%
% A number of entries can be given a language tag. Such a language is
% given by using an \enquote{optional argument} before the text:
%
% \begin{verbatim}
% \hypersetup{pdftitle={[en]english,[de]deutsch}}
% \hypersetup{pdfsubtitle={[en]subtitle in english}}
% \end{verbatim}
%
% \subsection{Rights}
% The keys |pdfcopyright| and |pdflicenseurl| work similar as in \pkg{hyperxmp}.
% But differently to \pkg{hyperxmp} the code doesn't set the |xmpRights:Marked|
% property, as I have some doubts that one deduce its value simply
% by checking if the other keys have been used; if needed it should be added manually.
%
% \subsection{PDF related data}
% The PDF producer is for all engines by default built from the engine
% name and the engine version and doesn't use the banners as with \pkg{hyperxmp}
% and \pkg{pdfx}, it can be set manually with the |pdfproducer| key.
%
% The key |pdftrapped| is ignored. |Trapped| is deprecated in PDF 2.0.
%
% \subsection{Document data}
%
% The authors should be given with the |pdfauthor| key, separated by commas. If an
% author contains a comma, protect/hide it by a brace.

% \subsection{User commands}
%  The XMP-meta data are added automatically. This can be suppressed with the
%  |\DocumentMetadata| key |xmp|.
%
% \begin{function}{\pdfmeta_xmp_add:n}
% \begin{syntax}
% \cs{pdfmeta_xmp_add:n}\Arg{XML}
% \end{syntax}
% With this command additional XML code can be added to the Metadata.
% The content is added unchanged, and not sanitized.
% \end{function}
% \begin{function}{\pdfmeta_xmp_xmlns_new:nn}
% \begin{syntax}
% \cs{pdfmeta_xmp_xmlns_new:nn}\Arg{prefix}\Arg{uri}
% \end{syntax}
% With this command a xmlns name space can be added.

% \subsubsection{Functions to check a requirement}
% At first two commands to get the standard value if needed:
% \begin{macro}[EXP]{\pdfmeta_standard_item:n}
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new:Npn \pdfmeta_standard_item:n #1
 {
   \prop_item:Nn \g_@@_standard_prop {#1}
 }
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \begin{macro}{\pdfmeta_standard_get:nN}
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_protected:Npn \pdfmeta_standard_get:nN #1 #2
 {
   \prop_get:NnN \g_@@_standard_prop {#1} #2
 }
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% Now two functions to check the requirement. A simple and one value/handler based.
% \begin{macro}[pTF]{\pdfmeta_standard_verify:n}
%  This is a simple test is the requirement is in the prop.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\prg_new_conditional:Npnn \pdfmeta_standard_verify:n #1 {T,F,TF}
  {
     \prop_if_in:NnTF \g_@@_standard_prop {#1}

       {
         \prg_return_true:
       }
  }
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \begin{macro}[TF]{\pdfmeta_standard_verify:nn}
% This allows to test against a user value. It calls a test handler if this
% exists and passes the user and the standard value to it. The test
% handler should return true or false.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\prg_new_protected_conditional:Npnn \pdfmeta_standard_verify:nn #1 #2  {T,F,TF}

      {
        \prg_return_true:
      }
   }
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
% Now we setup a number of handlers.
%
% The first actually ignores the user values and tests against the
% current pdf version. If this is smaller than the minimum we report a failure.
% |#1| is the user value, |#2| the reference value from the standard.
% \begin{macro}{\@@_standard_verify_handler_min_pdf_version:nn}

% \subsubsection{Enforcing requirements}
%  A number of requirements can sensibly be enforced by us.
%  \paragraph{Annot flags}
% pdf/A require a number of settings here, we store them in a command which
% can be added to the property of the standard:
%    \begin{macrocode}

  }
%    \end{macrocode}
% At begin document this should be checked:

% \subsubsection{Colorprofiles and Outputintents}
% The following provides a minimum of interface to add a color profile
% and an outputintent need for PDF/A for now. There will be need to extend it later,
% so we try for enough generality.
%
% Adding a profile and an intent is technically easy:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Embed the profile as stream with
% \begin{verbatim}
%  \pdf_object_unnamed_write:nn{fstream} {{/N~4}{XXX.icc}}
% \end{verbatim}
% \item Write a |/OutputIntent| dictionary for this
% \begin{verbatim}
% \pdf_object_unnamed_write:nx {dict}
%  {
%    /Type /OutputIntent
%    /S /GTS_PDFA1  % or GTS_PDFX or ISO_PDFE1 or ...
%    /DestOutputProfile \pdf_object_ref_last: % ref the color profile
%    /OutputConditionIdentifier ...
%    ... %more info
%  }
% \end{verbatim}
% \item Reference the dictionary in the catalog:
% \begin{verbatim}
% \pdfmanagement_add:nnx {Catalog}{OutputIntents}{\pdf_object_ref_last:}
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{enumerate}
% But we need to do a bit more work, to get the interface right.
% The object for the profile should be named, to allow l3color to reuse it
% if needed. And we need container to store the profiles, to handle the
% standard requirements.
%
% \begin{variable}{\g_@@_outputintents_prop}
% This variable will hold the profiles for the subtypes. We assume
% that every subtype has only only color profile.
